data-science-template
==============================

A starting place for data science projects. This readme should be updated  
so that it is a starting point for the partners who will be receiving this 
repository and associated work.

Getting Started Instructions 
==============================

How to start: ....

<Fill in information for Receiving Company to be able to deploy, use, and/or reproduce results. >

<Including, e.g., docker installation instructions, how to run or deploy the solution/program, and run any tests.>



Docker Setup
--------------------

### Installation
Before proceeding further, please install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) following the instructions provided in the [link here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your choice of operating system. 

### Setup 

From this project folder run the following command in your terminal to build and deploy the JupyterLab container:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
Use `CTRL + C` to stop JupyterLab and exit the docker container. 

To run the container in detached mode add `-d` as follows:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

If you have successfully built and deployed the JupyterLab image container using either of the above commands, you can access the web interface of the JupyterLab at 
```
http://localhost:8888
```

You might be prompted to enter the token while accessing the `http://localhost:8888`. The token can be obtained from the logs of the running JupyterLab container as follows. 

```
docker logs <container-id>
```

To view the list of all the containers and get the container id of the JupyterLab, run 
```
docker ps -a
```
