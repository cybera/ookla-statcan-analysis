Ookla Open Data and Statistics Canada Internet Analysis
==============================

Comparative analysis of the 
[Statistics Canada National Broadband Internet Service Availability Map](https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/sitt/bbmap/hm.html?lang=eng) 
and the speed test data made available through 
[Ookla’s Open Data Initiative ](https://www.ookla.com/ookla-for-good/open-data).

You can regenerate similar on *nix systems using:
     ```$tree -a -I '.git|.gitkeep|__init__.py'```

Getting Started Instructions 
==============================

Either create a virtual or conda environt with the required python packages, including the aws cli. The AWS command line interface
is needed to easily download the Ookla open data using:
```bash
aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://ookla-open-data/ ./data/ookla-raw
```



Docker Setup
--------------------

### Installation
Before proceeding further, please install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) following the instructions provided in the [link here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your choice of operating system. 

### Setup 

From this project folder run the following command in your terminal to build and deploy the JupyterLab container:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
Use `CTRL + C` to stop JupyterLab and exit the docker container. 

To run the container in detached mode add `-d` as follows:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

If you have successfully built and deployed the JupyterLab image container using either of the above commands, you can access the web interface of the JupyterLab at 
```
http://localhost:8888
```

You might be prompted to enter the token while accessing the `http://localhost:8888`. The token can be obtained from the logs of the running JupyterLab container as follows. 

```
docker logs <container-id>
```

To view the list of all the containers and get the container id of the JupyterLab, run 
```
docker ps -a
```
